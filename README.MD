# simple google chrome github extension

now it only makes the `from` on pullrequest clickable

there is prepacked extension in the build folder and source files in the src

the extension could be installed from [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/microgithubextension/fcjonpkgeobklldjidfkkihfgcgbmabc)

if you invent any other augments for the github you would like to see i nthis extension, feel free to open issue (pull requests are also welcomed )
